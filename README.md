# Undercover Elf

Undercover Elf is a Secret Santa style app made for my family as a more user-friendly alternative to current popular sites such as [DrawNames](https://drawnames.co.uk).

## About Undercover Elf

The free-to-use Secret Santa style websites currently available are often populated with many adverts of suggestions of items to put on their wishlists, which was confusing for my ageing parents. Undercover Elf eliminated this issue, and also gave me freedom to write more explicit instructions of how to use the site than is generally available on free-to-use sites.

Users can securely create their own accounts using AWS Cognito, with the ability to change their password. When a user creates a new group, an invitation ID and link are generated. This ID can can be sent to friends and family to easily search for the group on their account, or click the link to join the group directly. When a group is created, the creator is registered as the admin, and can edit the group's name, budget, and gift exchange date. Users have a wishlist for each group, where items can be added, edited, or deleted.
